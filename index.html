    <h1> Hobbies </h1>
    <p> I love to play volleyball.
I play with my friends mostly but sometimes I play with my Dad.
Right now, there aren't any volleyball teams until December because this isn't one of the seasons coaches play.</p>
<h1> Favorite Foods</h1>
<p> I love Mac & Cheese, Brownies, Gushers, and Skittles. 
    My all time favorite though is Skittles.</p>
